-- Question:
-- Jack Frost wants to review all the cocoa breaks he actually took — including the cocoa type and the location he drank it in. How would you combine the necessary tables to show each logged break with its matching cocoa details and location?

-- Table Schema:
-- Table: cocoa_logs
--   log_id: INT
--   break_id: INT
--   cocoa_id: INT
--
-- Table: break_schedule
--   break_id: INT
--   location_id: INT
--
-- Table: cocoa_types
--   cocoa_id: INT
--   cocoa_name: VARCHAR
--
-- Table: locations
--   location_id: INT
--   location_name: VARCHAR
--

-- My Solution:

SELECT 
     c.log_id,
     c.break_id,
     l.location_name,
     ct.cocoa_name
FROM cocoa_logs c
JOIN break_schedule b on c.break_id = b.break_id
JOIN cocoa_types ct on ct.cocoa_id = c.cocoa_id
JOIN locations l on l.location_id = b.location_id
